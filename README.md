This repository only contain UF2 files for [Raspberry pi pico examples](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples)

The reason is that I'm unable to find precompiled UF2 files for raspberry pi pico, at first I tried to follow the instruction from [Getting Started with the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://rptl.io/pico-get-started) using Raspberry Pi 3 and raspbian, but I can't get it running, next I used docker and it works like a charm, which gives me the UF2 files that I can share.

This version is pulled and compiled on 2024 Feb 14

This version is provided without Pico W (the reason is that when I compile each section, Pico W was left blank and I don't have time to deal with it for now, I'll find time later)

TinyUSB Example also exclude tinyusb\_dev\_net\_lwip\_webserver for the same reason as above
